**1.Reversing a number in Java**
Suppose, we want to reverse the number 1234. 
We have taken three variables, 
*number (the number to be reversed), 
*remainder (stores the remainder), 
*reverse (stores the reverse number) initialized 0. 

**2.FibonacciSeries in Java**
In fibonacci series, next number is the sum of previous two numbers for example 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55 etc.

**3.PrimeNumber in Java**
Prime number is a number that is greater than 1 and divided by 1 or itself only. In other words, prime numbers can't be divided by other numbers than itself or 1. 
For example 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17 are the prime numbers.

**4.PalindromeNumber in Java**
A palindrome number is a number that is same after reverse. For example 545, 151, 34543, 343, 171, 48984 are the palindrome numbers.
It can also be a string like LOL, MADAM etc.

**5.FactorialNumber in Java**
Factorial Program in Java: Factorial of n is the product of all positive descending integers. Factorial of n is denoted by n!.
For example:
4! = 4*3*2*1 = 24  
5! = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120 

**6.ArmstrongNumber in Java**
1: 1^1 = 1
2: 2^1 = 2
3: 3^1 = 3
153: 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125+ 27 = 153
125: 1^3 + 2^3 + 5^3 = 1 + 8 + 125 = 134 (Not an Armstrong Number)
